I learned a lot attending [AI Lowlands](https://ailowlands.com/) this week and wanted to share some links and highlights.

## gpt-realtime and vibevoice

OpenAI's gpt-realtime is available on [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/catalog/models/gpt-realtime) very fast but quite expensive.

Microsoft just launched [VibeVoice-Realtime](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/VibeVoice-Realtime-0.5B).

## llms.txt and NLweb

[llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) as a way to provide LLM-friendly content has been around for a little while.

Microsoft proposes [NLweb](https://github.com/nlweb-ai/NLWeb) as a proof-of-concept for conversational interfaces and a semantic layer for the web.

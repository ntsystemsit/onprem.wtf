> Technological change is not additive; it is ecological. A new medium does not add something; it changes everything.

I've been thinking about this quote from media theorist Neil Postman lately. 
Written in the 1990s about television's impact on society, it feels more relevant than ever as we watch AI reshape our industry.

## From Smartphones to AI: Patterns of Change

Consider the smartphone: it didn't just add a portable phone to our lives - 
it transformed how we navigate spaces (goodbye paper maps), coordinate socially 
(from fixed meeting times to fluid arrangements), and process information. 
This wasn't simply adding features; it was a fundamental reshaping of our behaviors and capabilities.

## The AI Transformation in IT

Today, we're witnessing a similar ecological transformation with AI in the IT industry. 
Like previous technological waves, the initial phase brings a surge of integration work - 
much as we saw with cloud adoption. But AI isn't just another tool being added to our stack; 
it's reshaping the entire landscape of how we work.

The traditional cycle of coding, debugging, and deployment is evolving. 
But perhaps most intriguingly, while previous technological advances often reduced human interaction, 
AI might do the opposite. By handling routine tasks, it could create more space for 
meaningful human collaboration.

## Looking Ahead

However, this remains largely theoretical. 
While we're seeing increased integration work now, the deeper transformation of workplace 
dynamics will take time. Technology capabilities may advance rapidly, but organizational 
and human adaptation follows its own pace.

The challenge ahead isn't just technical implementation - 
it's about thoughtfully shaping AI's role to enhance rather than diminish human connection in our work. 
As with any ecological change, the outcomes will depend not just on the technology itself, 
but on how we choose to integrate it into our (professional) lives.
